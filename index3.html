    <h1>Explanation of the Computational Complexity Theory</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The Computational Complexity Theory is a theory that Manuel Blum contributed to. It is the inherent cost of solving a problem in a large-scale scientific computation, measure by the amount of calculations required as well as the amount of memory used. This theory is used to see how rapidly the solution time increases as the problem size increases, which can be used to find problems in algorithm designs and fix them.</p>
